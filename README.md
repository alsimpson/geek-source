This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## How to Use Locally via Git/GitHub
We've provided specifics on how to get going in [Project Setup](./requirements/01-project-setup) but here's a quick summary. You'll start by *forking* this project to your own account. UI mockups and requirements for each design can be found in the `requirements` directory. We'll be getting our data from the BestBuy.com developers API, which is covered [here](./requirements/01-project-setup/03-best-buy-api-creds). The `requirements` directory is broken up into chapters to guide you through the process. Be sure to check out the prologue; it'll prime your journey and provide you with some great insights from a veteran developer.

### Third-Party Tools
- Angular or React
- FontAwesome
- Google Web Fonts
- Styled Components (if using React)
- Jest
- BestBuy.com API

### Brand new to HTML/CSS/JS?
The way we've structured this project and its related content assumes that you already have some HTML, CSS, and JS skills and/or experience under your belt. If you're brand new to any of the three, you'll want to spend some time building your foundation and then come back to this project.
