# Beginner Resources

A strong HTML/CSS/JS foundation is required for success on any web-based application career path. Taking the time to build a solid foundation will pay dividends, so please don't skip this step if you're a beginner.

I've seen so many people jump straight to the "hard stuff" – Javascript and/or one of its frameworks/libraries such as React and Angular – completely bypassing HTML and CSS because they don't fully understand their value and importance. HTML and CSS are the foundation for everything you'll do as a frontend web developer. You'd also be surprised how frequently backend developers end up needing to reach for their HTML and CSS skills to hop over the fence to make some frontend tweaks. You can save yourself a ton of time and frustration if you just make the commitment to fully understand the ins and outs of HTML and CSS now. The hours you'll put into learning it now are nothing compared to the hours you'll spend fighting with the UI if you choose to skip the foundation.

Below are a number of resources to prime you on your journey. Learning is a process. Don't rush it. Enjoy the journey. Pretty soon, you won't remember what it was like to not know this stuff.
