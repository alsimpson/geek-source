## Learn the Lingo

Most professions have their own vernacular. Software development is no different. If you come across a word you donâ€™t know, look it up. Anytime you sit down to code or read about coding, have the resources you need to discover the definitions of new words or ideas you encounter at your fingertips. Google is a great resource. Full comprehension of the vernacular will expedite learning and make it much, much easier to communicate with your mentor and colleagues.
