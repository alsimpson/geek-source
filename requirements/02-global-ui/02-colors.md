## UI Colors

The colors you'll find throughout the UI are included below. You should already your color constants setup if you started from the top with "Chapter 1: Project Setup", though.

* Blue: `#032c48`
* Light Blue: `#798e9c`
* Red: `#e90c31`
* White: `#fff`

> Pro Tip:
The light blue color value was derived by putting the alpha of the primary blue color to 50%. [Polished](https://polished.js.org/) is an awesome package that has some color utilities such as `lighten` and `desaturate` that can make maintaining your color values super easy and clean. This ensures all of your colors change appropriately and relative to your primary color should it change.
